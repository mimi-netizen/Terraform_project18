## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to automate the setup and management of cloud infrastructure using Terraform. The configuration files in this repository provide the necessary scripts and templates to deploy infrastructure components efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) with appropriate permissions.
- Basic understanding of Terraform and cloud infrastructure concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mimi-netizen/Terraform_project18.git
   cd Terraform_project18
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Review the configuration files in this repository to understand the infrastructure being deployed.

## Usage

To apply the configuration and create the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the deployment.

To destroy the infrastructure when it's no longer needed:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
